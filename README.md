# Credit Card Churn Predictor ðŸ’³

## Description

The Credit Card Churn Predictor is a powerful machine learning tool that helps businesses forecast and prevent customer churn in their credit card services. Customer churn occurs when credit cardholders close their accounts, potentially leading to revenue loss and increased acquisition costs for the business. This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to identify patterns and predict which credit card customers are likely to churn based on historical data.
